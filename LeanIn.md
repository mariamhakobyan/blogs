#### Chapter 1: The Leadership Ambition Gap

#### Chapter 2: Sit at the Table

* It’s hard to visualize someone as a leader if he/she is always waiting to be told what to do.

* There is no perfect fit when you are looking for the next big thing to do. You have to take opportunities and make opportunity fit for you, rather than the other way around. The ability to learn is the most important quality a leader can have.

#### Chapter 3: Success and Likeability

* Owning one’s success is key to achieving more success. Professional advancement depends upon people believing that an employee is contributing to good results.

* Study shows that women can increase their chances of achieving a desired outcome by doing two things in combination. First, women must come across as being nice, concerned about others, and “appropriately” female. When women take a more instrumental approach (“This is what I want and deserve”), people react far more negatively.

* There is saying, "Think globally, act locally." When negotiating, "Think personally, act communally."

* According to Professor Bowles, the second thing women must do is provide a legitimate explanation for the negotiation.

* In negotiation, in order to justify the requests, you need 
 1. to suggest that someone more senior encouraged the negotiation (“My manager suggested I talk with you about my compensation”) OR
 
 1. to cite industry standards (“My understanding is that jobs that involve this level of responsibility are compensated in this range“)

* When you want to change things, you can't please everyone. If you do please everyone, you aren't making enough progress.

#### Chapter 4: It's a Jungle Gym, Not a Ladder

* Let's analyse the following case: Person wants to apply for a company.
- "I thought about calling you and telling you all of the things I'm good at and all of the things I like to do. Then I figured out that everyone was doing that. So, instead, I want to ask you: "What is your (company's) biggest problem and how can I solve it?"".

* We all want a job or role that truly excites and engages us. This search requires both focus and flexibility, so I recommend adopting two concurrent goals: a long-term dream and an eighteen-month plan.

* Everyone should have an eighteen-month plan (eighteen months, because two years seem too long and one year seems too short, but it does not have to be any exact amount of time).

* Only one criterion matters when picking a job - fast growth. When companies grow quickly, there are more things to do than there are people to do them.

* Reduce your career spreadsheets to one column: potential for growth.

* If you are offered a seat on a rocket ship, you don't ask what seat. You just get on.

* Elect the work, where your experience would be in demand so you can have the greatest impact.

* If you are afraid to do something, it's usually because you are either not good at it or perhaps you are too scared even to try.

* Negotiation deal: Letting the other side make the first offer is often crucial to achieving favorable results/terms.

* Communication coach advice: For one week you can not give your opinion unless asked.

* Trying to overcorrect is a great way to find middle ground. In order for me to speak the right amount in a meeting, I have to feel as if I'm saying very little.

* Risk and great deal of luck - can land you anywhere you want.

* In many cases, woman need to be more open to taking risks in their careers.

* At times, staying in the same functional area and in the same organisation creates inertia and limits opportunity to expand. Seeking out diverse experiences is useful preparation for leadership.

* Being risk averse in the workplace can also cause woman to be more reluctant to take on challenging tasks.

* Woman need to shift from thinking "I am not ready to do that" to thinking "I want to do that - and I will be learning by doing that".

* Hard work and results ***should*** be recognised by others, but when they aren't, advocating for oneself becomes necessary.

* Taking risks, choosing growth, challenging ourselves, and asking for promotions are all important elements of managing a career.

* ***The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.***

#### Chapter 5: Are You My Mentor?

* Alice Walker: "The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any".

* When someone finds the right mentor, it's obvious.

* I mentor, when I see something and I say: "I want to see that grow".

* Mentorship and sponsorship are crucial for career progression. Both man and woman with sponsors are more likely to ask for stretch assignments and pay raises than their pairs of the same gender without sponsors.

* Intuitively, people invest in those who stand out for their talent or who can really benefit from help.

* Capturing someone's attention or imagination in a minute can be done, but only when planned and tailored to that individual.

* Preparation is especially important when looking for a job (question like "What's Facebook's culture like?" shows more ignorance than interest in the company, since there are hundreds of articles that provide the answer).

* A person gave me great advice about asking for advise. He told me to figure out what I wanted to do *before* I went to see the people who had the ability to hire me.

* Getting the attention of a senior person with a virtuoso performance works, but it's not the only way to get a mentor.

* ***Asking for an input is not a sign of weakness but often the first step to finding a path forward.***

#### Chapter 6: Seek and Speak Your Truth

* Effective communication starts with the understanding that there is my point of view (my truth) and someone else's point of view (his truth).

* Truth is better served by using simple language.

* When communicating hard truths, less is often more.

* The ability to listen is as important as the ability to speak.

* Being aware of a problem is the first step to correcting it.

* Feedback, remember, like truth, is not absolute. Feedback is an opinion, grounded in observations and experiences, which allows us to know what impression we make on others. The information is revealing and potentially uncomfortable, which is why all of us would rather offer feedback to those who welcome it.

* "How can I do better?", "What am I doing that I don't know", "What am I *not* doing that I don't see?" - these questions can lead to many benefits. And believe me, the truth hurts. Even when I have solicited feedback, any judgment can feel harsh. But the upside of painful knowledge is so much greater than the downside of blissful ignorance.

* Requesting advice can also help build relationship.

* At Facebook, when I joined, I asked Mark for a commitment that he would give me feedback every week so that anything that bothered him would be aired and discussed quickly.

* Being open to hearing the truth (true feedback) means taking responsibility for mistakes.

* Another way I try to foster authentic communication is to speak openly about my own weaknesses.

* I give others permission to bring up my impatience and joke about it too.

* Humor can be an amazing tool for delivering an honest message in a good-natured way. A recent study even found that "sense of humor" was the phrase most frequently used to describe the most effective leaders. I have seen humor get results so many times.

* Unfortunately, our sense of humor sometimes fails us when we need it most. When you get emotional, it's very hard to treat the problem lightly.

* Most woman believe - and research suggests that it's not a good idea to cry at work.

* ***Sharing emotions builds deeper relationships. Motivation comes from working on things we care about. It also comes from working with people we care about.***

* Recognising the role emotions play and willing to discuss them makes us better managers, partners and peers.

* In one-to-one meetings each week, I would enter my manager's office with a typed agenda and get right to it. I thought I was being so efficient, but my colleague Tim kindly pulled me aside one day to give me some advice, to take a moment to connect with Omid (reviewer) before diving in. It was clear who had mentioned this to Tim.

* It has been an evolution, but I'm now a true believer in bringing our whole-selves to work. Professional decisions are often emotionally driven, this is the truth.

* We are moving towards at least blurring the line between personal and professional.

* True leadership stems from individuality that is honestly and sometimes imperfectly expressed. They believe leaders should strive for authenticity over perfection.

#### Chapter 7: Don't Leave Before You Leave

* I carry a little notebook with my to-do list - *an actual noteboook* that I write in with *an actual pen* (In tech world this is like carrying a stone tablet and chisel).

* Woman wind up leaving the workforce precisely because of things they did *to stay in* the workforce.

* The months and years leading up to having children are not the time to lean back, but the critical time to lean in.

* ***Personal choices are not always as personal as they appear. We are all influenced by social conventions, peer pressure and familial expectations.***

* Choosing to leave a child in someone else's care and return to work is difficult decision. Any parent, who has done this, myself included, knows how heart wrenching it can be. ***Only a compelling, challenging, and rewarding job will begin to make that choice a fair contest.***

* Don't enter the workforce already looking for the exit. Don't put on the brakes. Accelerate. Keep a foot on the gas pedal until a decision must be made. That's the only way to ensure, that when that day comes, there will be a real decision to make.

####  Chapter 8: Make Your Partner a Real Partner

* Research confirms that equality between partners leads to happier relationships.

#### Chapter 9: The Myth of Doing It All

* ***We compare our efforts at work to those of our colleagues, usually man, who typically have far fewer responsibilities at home. Then we compare our efforts at home to those of mothers who dedicate themselves solely to their families.***

* Long-term success at work often depends on *not* trying to meet every demand placed on us. The best way to make room for both life and career is to make choices deliberately - to set limits and stick to them.

* I was back on e-mail from my hospital room the day after giving birth.

* The new normal means that there are just not enough hours in the day.

* I would schedule a meeting with someone for 9:00 AM and the person would not show up, assuming that I meant 9:00 PM.

* I have remarkable resources - ***a husband*** who is a real partner, ***the ability to hire great people*** to assist me both in the office and at home, and a ***good measure of control over my schedule***.

* Study shows that the pressure society places on woman to stay home and do "what's best for the child" is based on emotion, not evidence.

* Parental behavioral factors - including fathers who are responsive & positive, mothers who favor "self-directed child behavior", and parents with emotional intimacy in their marriages - influence a child's development 2 to 3 times more than any form of child care.

* Finding says: "Exclusive maternal case was not related to better or worse outcomes for children, There is, thus, no reason for mothers to feel as though they are arming their children if they decide to work".

* Guilt management can be just as important as time management for mothers. When I went back to my job after giving birth, other working mothers told me to prepare for the day that my son would cry for his nanny.

* Stanford professor Jennifer Aaker's work shows that setting obtainable goals is key to happiness.

* The right question is not "Could I do it all?", but "Can I do what's most important for me and my family?".

* If I had to embrace a definition of success, it would be that success is making the best choices we can...and accepting them.

#### Chapter 10: Let's Start Talking About It

* There are differences between men and women both in their behavior and in the way their behavior is perceived by others.

* The simple act of talking openly about behavioral patterns makes the subconscious conscious.

* Talking can transform minds, which can transform behaviors, which can transform institutions.

* Shutting-down discussion is self-defeating and impedes progress.

* In conversation, a more junior woman (man) can gently but firmly tell the group: "Before we move on, I'd like to hear what [senior woman] had to say". This action not only benefits the senior woman, but can raise the stature of the junior woman as well, since speaking up for someone else displays both confidence and a communal spirit.

* Every job will demand some sacrifice. The key is to avoid *unnecessary* sacrifice.

* ***"Leadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence".***

* When offered a more specific definition of feminism - "A feminist is someone who believes in social, political, and economic equality of the sexes." - the percentage of woman, who agree to be called as feminists, rises to 65%.

#### Chapter 11: Working Together Toward Equality

* Instead of ignoring differences between men and women, we need to accept and transcend them.

* One of the conflicts inherent in having choice is that we all make different ones. There is always an opportunity cost, and I don't know any woman who feels comfortable with all her decisions.

* ***Until woman have supportive employers and colleagues as well partners who share family responsibilities, they don't have real choice. And, until man are fully respected for contributing inside the home, they don't have real choice either. Equal opportunity is not equal unless everyone receives the encouragement that makes seizing those opportunities possible. Only then can both men and women achieve their full potential! ***

* Social norms no longer exist. If more children see fathers at school pickups and mothers who are busy at jobs, both girls and boys will envision more options for themselves. Expectations will not be set by gender, but by ***personal passion***, ***talents*** and ***interest***.

* What I have achieved, and much more, is possible for many others.

* Filled with energy, optimism and self-confidence, women scrambling along that jungle gym and moving toward their long-term dream.

* Throwing up our hands and saying "It can't be done" ensures that it will ***never*** be done.

* In the future, there will be no female leaders. There will just be leaders.

* We need to be grateful for what we have, but dissatisfaction motivates the charge for change.
